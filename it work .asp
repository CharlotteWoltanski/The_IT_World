IT Work
The IT industry is large, varied and changes over time. It also easy to get a misleading impression of what is typically
involved on a day-to-day basis from a job advertisement or a position description. In order to help you understand this,
the best way seems to be to hear from some IT professionals about their daily work.
There are two ways in which you can do this, as below.
1. Interview an IT professional
2. View, summarise and discuss at least 10 recent YouTube videos or other web sources (you may be surprised how
many hits there are for a search on A day in the life of an IT professional ).

You as a group need to choose one of these two approaches. If it all possible, it is strongly recommended that you (as a
group) interview an IT professional . Not only will this information be more direct, it may provide you with a contact that 2
you will find helpful in the future. If you choose this option, use the questions below as a guide.
If you choose the web sources option, you need to report on 5 different IT professionals, as well as indicate your 10
sources.
Whichever source of information you use, you should answer the following questions.
1. What kind of work is done by the IT professional?
2. What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT
professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?
3. Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?
4. What aspect of their position is most challenging?
