        <h1> FeedBack </h1>
        <h2>Charlotte</h2>
      <p><b>Kiel</b>- was extremely hard working and a highly active member of the group as he was so supportive of each member of the group, ensuring their ideas were heard and acted upon. Kiel assisted me the most when designing and coding the HTML files by creating two pages and being one of the final judges with all design aspects and information. </p>
    <p><b>Laura</b>- was always dedicated to what she was assigned to, producing quality pieces of work, and doing though research to ensure she had the best quality and trusted information. Laura was always reassuring to members in need and offered endless help to the rest of the group. </p> 
        <p><b>Aydan</b>- proceeded to be a very productive member in the group as he was always willing to give up his time to do extra work if needed. Aydan always addressed his ideas and thought for the websites and project which helped tremendously as I had confident answers on how my design aspects were going and reevaluated the information given to me.</p>
        <p><b>Tanveer</b>- was highly enthusiastic when it came to producing his work, it was always submitted to teams before the due date we assigned. Tanveer was a very helpful member to the group as he was also willing to work on anything assigned to him and offered in any way to help out the team.</p>
        <p><b>Adi</b>- overall produced quality work but did take a little longer on it than the rest of the group, but we were still able to receive quality information from him. Adi enabled the group to have a friendly environment as we could joke around and gain a stronger connection to each person in the group, which resulted in a welcoming environment so no one felt like they were unheard and everyone was able to voice their opinions. </p>

        <h1> FeedBack </h1>
        <h2>Laura</h2>
        <p><b>Charlotte</b>- contributed a lot of effort into HTML and CSS and keeping us updated with what the websites state was currently in. She also encouraged other team members to finish their work and set deadlines and goals for our work. She performed well and if it wasn't for Charlotte, we would probably be lagging behind.</p>
        <p><b>Kiel</b>- contributed a lot of effort into HTML and CSS too alongside Charlotte. Kiel also worked on a large part of the assignment 2 specifications. He performed well also. Kiel and Charlotte both acted as team leaders for this project.</p>
        <p><b>Aydan</b>- performed well and contributed a lot to the assignment. He was always available for a group meeting and contributed good ideas for the group project. Aydan and Tanveer wrote out the project idea with ideas from the rest of the group to even out the contribution of everyone.</p>
        <p><b>Tanveer</b>- was very helpful and contributed a lot to the assignment. He performed well and put in a lot of effort into his work. He was always available for a team meeting and strived to do more work if needed. He contributed good ideas for the group project.</p>
        <p><b>Adi</b>- took quite a while to finally pick a task from the assignment 2 specifications. It was often difficult to plan a group meeting as he worked often and had to change the meeting time multiple times. He did not stick to work deadlines, however in the end he did finish his assignment part.</p>

        <h2>Kiel</h2>
    <p><b>Charlotte</b>- the team's work ethics are solid. Charlotte stepped up as a leader when I couldn't keep up with the university workload and greatly fulfilled my role by segregating delegating tasks per each member's strength. Charlotte also spent the most time in creating our website's HTML and CSS. Her work in CSS and HTML is very organized and thus, greatly helped me when I was adding and designing other pages because nothing was all over the place.</p>
    <p><b>Laura</b>- is an important part of the group, as she holds everyone together and does her part to the best of her ability when she's assigned to something. She also acts as a secretary of the group when it comes to meetings, as I assigned to summarise the key points I discuss with my fellow members.</p>
    <p><b>Aydan</b>- performed his task very well without any complaints and finished very quickly. He, along with other members helped Charlotte and I focus on doing our more time-consuming jobs by being the person in the group that nudges others to work and guides them on what they could do when they are lost.</p>
    <p><b>Tanveer</b>-is probably the most keen person I have ever been in a group with when it comes to being delegated a task. Tanveer is very energetic and WANTS parts assigned to him, and for his group members to count on his abilities and capabilities when it comes to group works.</p>
    <p><b>Adi</b>- despite submitting some stuff late (due to understandable circumstances), tried his best and contributed his part that was delegated on to him. Adi kept the group's mood light despite all the stress and made everyone feel at ease. As far as I have seen, Adi seemed to do his part efficiently and effectively."</p>

        <h2>Tanveer</h2>
