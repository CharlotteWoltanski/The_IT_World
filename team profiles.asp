Personal information
One paragraph per person, including name, recent photo student number, background, hobbies, IT interest and
IT experience.This should also include your teamâ€™s chosen name.

Team Profile
The test outcomes for each person in the team (all 3 tests), and your understanding of how this information
may be helpful to the group. You should do this as soon as your group is formed. You will have a chance to
reflect on how well the group has worked later.

Ideal Jobs
Compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group. This may have changed due to feedback
from Assignment 1. What common elements are there, if any? What differentiates each position from the
others, if anything? How similar or different are your career plans across the group?
