               <h1> Kiel Bustamante </h1> 
               
               <p>My name is Kiel Bustamante, a 5 Foot 8 (172.72cm) pure Filipino currently living in Melbourne. I have chosen to study at RMIT University to pursue a bachelor in IT because computers have always been my passion since I was a child. My Email and Student number are S3842028@student.rmit.edu.au and S3842028</p> 
               <p>Although born Filipino (in the Philippines), I can speak English, Nihongo (Japanese), Espanol (Spanish), and of course, Filipino. I have so far completed Year 10 to 12 here in Australia, with my transition from Philippines to Singapore and finally to Australia being very smooth. I am an avid gamer that grew up in a household filled with engineers, but some also were graphic and website designers at the same time. This meant that every corner of the house I went to, there was something computer related going on, which ignited a fire within me to seek more knowledge about IT and to pursue a career in Cyber Security. Quite recently though, I was asked by my organisation, AISA (The Australian Information Security Association), to come to the Australian Cyber Conference 2019 as a high school delegate. </p>
               <p>I was the only high school member at that point, and wrote an article for them. I met famous IT figures personally, including Kevin Mitnick and Dr Karl Kruszelnicki. This conference further reinforced my interest in Cyber Security, Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and the future of the IT field. My main goal is to become a Cyber Security Director, specializing in consulting. As a Director, I will have to focus on the aspect of expanding our business in the market by succeeding in opportunities given by the clients and earning their trust as an advisor that way. The job demands a lot of hard-earned requirements, but it is as expected of a position as high as a Director, especially in the Cyber Security field. However, to get there, I will most likely pursue being a Cyber Security Engineer as my profession to begin my journey. </p>

My family is a nuclear family consisting of my parents and my younger brother. I have completed my 10th and 12th from The Senior Study-II School which is CBSE affiliated in year 2017 and 2019 respectively and scored 9.4 CGPA in 10th.</p> 
                               <p>After that I opted for Non-Medical in which I scored 75% in grade 12th and studied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, English and Physical Education as my core subjects. I speak three languages which are English, Punjabi and Hindi. I love to take part in outdoor sports like Cricket, Basketball and Football.</p> 
                               <p>Artificial intelligence is one of the biggest reasons that I wanted to study IT. AI is the future of technology as nowadays we can notice that many of our daily tasks are done by the machines which are programmed to perform a particular task. Some of the well-known AI's are Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa and Cortona. I hope someday I could create an AI of my own. Currently, I am pursuing Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, so I do not have any IT experience yet, but I hope that I could gain some experience by engaging in internship programs or by attending IT fares and seminars from famous developers and coders.</p> 
                               <p>My team's chosen name is Master Chef. My Ideal job is Robotics Software Engineer, someone who is responsible for creating a robot’s system. Complex programs are developed by a robotics software engineer which ensures the robot is not only working, but also efficient and effective in its tasks. This job is very appealing to me because through this job I will get a chance to develop systems and engage with robots.</p>

                               <p>I am aiming to become a Software Engineer, mostly because it is a graduate position and I like the idea of developing or creating software operating systems.
