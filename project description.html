                <h1>Roles</h1>
              <h4>Charlotte & Kiel – Lead Developers</h4>  
              <p>Our group is a mix between team roles and no specific roles. Charlotte and Kiel are both Lead Developers with a strong leadership capability in organising the times for group meetings and encouraging the team to meet team deadlines for work submission. Their role was not defined by votes but by a natural unfoldings in their prior experience in leading our team to success in previous assignments. They are both working on HTML and CSS for the team as they’re both individually experienced in the opposing coding language between each other. This means that while the other has difficulties in one coding language, the other is experienced and can provide insight into problems they run into and vice versa.</p>
              <h4>Tanveer, Adi, Aydan, Laura – No specific role</h4>
              <p>The rest of the team have no specific roles as we all chose two different topics to cover, with one being difficult and the other topic to write about is much easier. This assists the team to equal the workload between team members. This also provides the opportunity for each member to work on different kinds of IT topics and work. We provide support and solutions to HTML and CSS problems that are voiced during team meetings and complete written tasks.</p>

              <h1>Scope and Limits</h1>
                <p>Our group project idea is quite complex which means we will need to break our project up initially to make it simple enough to understand the gist of what our project delivers, but also is reasonable enough in the amount of time we have. Our end project idea is a Home Security Bot which can be used at home or at stores to travel its environment to monitor criminal activity such as break-ins and thieves. It does this by recording, capturing screenshots and recording its surrounding area as it travels through its designated area. It has multiple cameras, a microphone and can send the user notifications through an app. We can narrow the complexity of this project by describing the deliverables for our project. Our project must include an AI bot who roams its environment and has at least a single camera and microphone that can send a notification to the user when it senses movement and can Livestream its footage and audio. We can dismiss many other features till much later in its development. These features include having multiple cameras, the ability to set its designated roaming area and user to bot commands. Another feature that is time-consuming and complex which should be left till the last development phase is the bot’s ability to recognise a sound and travel to its location to supervise and record. It was also planned that the bot when used in stores, warehouses etc. will be able to check stock, however that is very technical and will need to be filtered out in the first development phase of the bot demonstration. Notifications sent to the user at first will be very simple and will only send messages to the user when a movement in the bot’s vision can be detected. The movement can be anything and as the project progresses through to the end-product, it will be able to distinguish between a human and other movements and objects.The live streaming of video footage and audio will be available when the user opens the bot via an app on their phone and when motion is detected when the user is absent, the bot will record the footage and audio of this. Otherwise the bot’s recorded footage will not be accessible, it will only record footage when it detects motion.</p>

We called twice within the week to first assign work to each group member, and the second call was a catch up on how everyone was going with the assignment. We made sure to have a fair work share as everyone had two parts of the Project Ideas section, we decided each member should have an easy one and a harder one so everyone had their fair share. To ensure everyone was doing alright with the work we had a follow-up call, where any of the group members could ask for help or clarification on a question, the call was successful and ideas of updating the previous website were questioned as well.  For Kiel and Charlotte as Tech leads, they needed to fix the Navigation bar to be responsive to screen size as well as adjusting the index page to the same standards. As we all decided to keep the pre-existing website, some changes needed to be made such as IT Work and IT technologies needed to be removed and replaced with Project Description and Project Ideas. We also decided that a documentation/tools pages to organise web-references, this time frame and video recordings from teams. Our main milestone for the week was just to familiarise everyone to the tasks they have been assigned too. </td>

Besides everyone working individually there was no significant improvements to the assignment made. A Github was set up with the following website HTML and CSS files for the new assignment, plus the files had a further tidying up as there was some issues with the previous website and duplicated code. The main milestone of this week was to make the website device size friendly for any device, as the website previously wasn’t suited to mobile devices.</td>

The group also called to debate on how the information would be displayed on the website to ensure everyone was happy with the end result, we also discussed how everyone was going with their work and if they needed any assistance or clarity on any issues.
