        <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>

        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
        <p>Cyber Security is how we defend our electronic devices from bad malware and virus to ensure there is no leak of private data. It is also known as Information Technology Security or Electronic Information Security.  There are many different fields for cuber security as information technology is huge. Network, Application and information security are three of the main tasks for Cyber Security, which can either be assessed by a human or run through an AI application. Cyber Security is mainly done by AI’s as humans program them to be more efficient and have threat detectors. As Humans are prone to make mistakes and miss information AI’s tend to be preferred in Network Security as it has a higher risk of leaking private information to the rest of the world. The state of the art refers to an overview of prominent risks, threats or policy issues in the field, as cybersecurity has a broad field throughout devices many issues can arise due to hackers, virus, accidents and many more.  Cybersecurity is in higher demand as everyone is now using the internet compared to 2000s where the internet was just starting to boom ad the creation of google happened two years before. Cyber Security is now in demand with all industries as they need people to fulfil jobs to keep up with the growing development of the internet, businesses want to ensure their websites have high security to keep out hackers and businesses also like to ensure their data is being kept in a secured location. But as Cybersecurity is always advancing because the internet and our knowledge of technology develops more and more every day, in this day and time humans are the only ones who can develop ad and virus blocker applications to help assist in protecting devices, but in the future they can create Artificial Intelligence robots to monitor devices to ensure there s no leak of information and the device is secured and safe. The development of AI’s is already in use but they can be built better and programmed to pick up on upcoming threats and develop a solution before any threats occur. There will also be smarter hackers that can also use AI’s to there advantage so there will still be a great need for cybersecurity management to update all AI’s with update knowledge and programmers to program the bots to perform each task and test each device. </p>
        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
         <p>Cyber Security is such a main part of everyone lives without them knowing it, every time a user using google, there are cybersecurity measures to ensure the user doesn’t get a virus by clicking the search button. Simple little extensions such as Ad blockers for YouTube create a cyber Security impact as well as it also removes the unwanted ads that you may accidentally click on or mistaken click on which can give you device a virus. Cyber Security can be a little feature of a massive feature in everyone's lives and it's still growing and developing. With the development of AI’s in the upcoming future, they will only be able to control applications not run major software test to ensure the security of a businesses website. But in years times AI development could become more advance where they can run professional hacking to check the stability of sites and find any errors in websites codes to ensure the safest possible design for the users and the business owners. In future years humans and AI’s will work together as humans can use the applications to simplify their jobs but they will still require manual labour as AI’s aren’t developed in all areas yet. AI’s will slowly make some jobs redundant as they can be programmed to search devices for viruses and malicious software. Cyber Security jobs will never become fully automated as people still need to program and design the AI’s as well as continually updated them with new knowledge and code to ensure they are performing at their best capacity and preform no errors.  </p>
         <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
         <p>Everything we do involving our devices links to cybersecurity each application, search option and video watched all have cybersecurity of a breach of data could occur. When you download apps from the internet on an application such as google chrome it runs a scan on the downloaded document and gives a warning whether or not you want to continue to process with downloading it with the warning that it could be a dangerous file. Chrome also has Cyber Security features such as having dangerous websites blocked from users accessing them. Cyber Security affects our daily lives already, in the future we suspect it will affect it even more as the internet is advancing and so is our knowledge of technology. We want our families and friends to be safe when using the internet so we can advise them to what applications are the best for protecting their devices and teach them how to detect basic threats like Facebook virus messages with links that you do not press.  </p>
