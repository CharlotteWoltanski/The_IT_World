        <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>

        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
        <p>Cyber Security is how we defend our electronic devices from bad malware and virus to ensure there is no leak of private information. It is also known as information technology security or electronic information security.  There are many different fields for cuber security as information technology is huge. Network, Application and information security are three of the main tasks for Cyber Security, which can either be assessed by a human or run through an AI application.  As our society is becoming more technology-dependent we need to ensure the protection of our virtual information. This can lead to a huge impact on the economic costs, reputation costs and regulatory costs. Economic costs are caused because of theft of information, which can costs business's or individual a lot of resources, money and time to resolve the loss and regain. Reputation costs have significant damages on businesses, as they can lose customers trust and gain a poor image of the media as the business had a cyber attack. And Regulatory costs is highly expensive as businesses have breached the data breach law which results in penalties and fines. To avoid cyber Attacks business should educate all employees of the risks and make them aware of basic scams such as Email virus, invest in security technology to ensure the business's data stays secure and safe, also enabling anti-virus software on all devices in the buildings will help prevent the risk. As cyber Security is mainly done by AI's as humans program them to be more efficient and have threat detectors. As Humans are prone to make mistakes and miss information AI's tend to be preferred in Network Security as it has a higher risk of leaking private information to the rest of the world. The state of the art refers to an overview of prominent risks, threats or policy issues in the field, as cybersecurity has a broad field throughout devices many issues can arise due to hackers planting a range of types of cyberattacks such as DoS, Hacking, Malware, Phishing, Spoofing, Ransomware and spamming. Cybersecurity is in higher demand as everyone is now using the internet compared to 2000s where the internet was just starting to boom ad the creation of google happened two years before. Now Cyber Security is in demand for jobs to keep up with the growing development of the internet, businesses want to ensure their websites have high security to keep out hackers and businesses also like to ensure their data is being kept in a secured location. But as Cybersecurity is always advancing because the internet and our knowledge of technology develops more and more every day, in this day and time humans are the only ones who can develop ad and virus blocker applications to help assist in protecting devices, but in the future they can create Artificial Intelligence robots to monitor devices to ensure there s no leak of information and the device is secured and safe. The development of AI's is already in use but they can be built better and programmed to pick up on upcoming threats and develop a solution before any threats occur. There will also be smarter hackers that can also use AI's to there advantage so there will still be a great need for cybersecurity management to update all AI's with update knowledge and programmers to program the bots to perform each task and test each device. </p>
        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
         <p>Cyber Security is such a main part of everyone lives without them knowing it, every time a user using google, there are cybersecurity measures to ensure the user doesn't get a virus by clicking the search button. Simple little extensions such as Ad blockers for YouTube create a cyber Security impact as well as it also removes the unwanted ads that you may accidentally click on or mistaken click on which can give you device a virus. Cyber Security can be a little feature of a massive feature in everyone's lives and it's still growing and developing. With the development of AI's in the upcoming future, they will only be able to control applications not run major software test to ensure the security of a businesses website. But in years times AI development could become more advance where they can run professional hacking to check the stability of sites and find any errors in websites codes to ensure the safest possible design for the users and the business owners. In future years humans and AI's will work together as humans can use the applications to simplify their jobs but they will still require manual labour as AI's aren't developed in all areas yet. AI's will slowly make some jobs redundant as they can be programmed to search devices for viruses and malicious software. Cyber Security jobs will never become fully automated as people still need to program and design the AI's as well as continually updated them with new knowledge and code to ensure they are performing at their best capacity and preform no errors.</p>
         <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
         <p>Everything we do involving our devices links to cybersecurity each application, search option and video watched all have cybersecurity of a breach of data could occur. When you download apps from the internet on an application such as google chrome it runs a scan on the downloaded document and gives a warning whether or not you want to continue to process with downloading it with the warning that it could be a dangerous file. Chrome also has Cyber Security features such as having dangerous websites blocked from users accessing them. Cyber Security affects our daily lives already, in the future we suspect it will affect it even more as the internet is advancing and so is our knowledge of technology. We want our families and friends to be safe when using the internet so we can advise them to what applications are the best for protecting their devices and teach them how to detect basic threats like Facebook virus messages with links that you do not press.  </p>

    <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
    <h4>What does it do?</h4>
    <p>Cloud is the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data, rather than using a local server or a personal computer. Cloud Computing is the delivery of different services through the internet. These include tools and applications like data storage, servers, database and networking software's. With the help of these clouds, we can keep our data and files of use in the cloud-based storage rather than storing them on local storage or hard drive. With the help of these clouds, we can access the data stored in the cloud anytime, anywhere the user wants. Cloud computing is growing these days in the businesses sector for several reasons including cost savings, increase productivity, speed-efficiency, performance and security. A cloud is managed by the provider on the user's behalf. It usually is an on-demand service and is on a subscription basis or pay-as-you-go. Cloud services are of two types: private cloud and public cloud. In a private cloud, a user can store anything and can have control of its privacy and security. User can configure and manage the cloud that fits their organizations need. Public cloud resources are available online for the public. It enables users to have quick access to applications, software or stored data without any configuration codes. Cloud computing is a big shift from traditional way businesses think about IT resources. Cloud computing reduces the expenses of buying hardware and software setting up and running on-site data centres. There is no need for the rack of servers, lots of electricity for power and cooling servers and also there is no need of IT experts for managing infrastructure. Because of all these benefits, Cloud adoption has seen a significant increase over the last few years and recent reports show that there will be a 50% increase in investment in cloud technology over next four years. Many companies are now rushing to migrate to the cloud because it goes hand in hand with innovation. Big companies are moving to the cloud because it offers the agility they need to compete in a fast-moving, rapidly changing customer environment. It saves industries the cost of maintaining their internal systems, drives innovation by making it easier to develop and change applications on the fly and it also helps standardize and simplify security management. The next few years, according to data from analyst firms like Gartner and IDC, are seeing cloud computing to evolve as a part of stacks that include the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing, or processing at the source of data ingestion. Gartner predicted that the worldwide public cloud services market will jump from $246.8 billion in 2017 to $287.8 billion this year and will reach $383 billion by 2020. Meanwhile, IDC predicted that by 2022, 75% of enterprise generated data is created and processed outside a traditional centralized data centre or cloud. Also, more than 40% of an organization's cloud deployment will include edge computing. Cloud computing concepts existed for many years and in fact, can be traced as far back as the 1950s with mainframe computing. In earlier times, computers were huge machines and very expensive and too difficult to buy and maintain for every single employee. As many organizations then implemented "time-sharing" schedules which enabled multiple users to access the central mainframe computer from connected stations. In the mid-1960s, a major advancement in cloud computing came as an American scientist conceptualized an interconnected system of computer known as "Advanced Research Projects Agency Network" known as ARPANET. Later many telecommunication companies began offering virtualized private networks. In the early 2000s, Amazon Web Services emerged and launched Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2006 and allowed companies to

      rent virtual computer through which they could use their programs and applications. Hence, First ever cloud was invented.</p>
    <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
    <p>From eCommerce sites to IT industry, businesses rely on technology to get exactly what they need and when they need it. The demand to access readily available information has spurred the development of cloud computing: the use of remote network servers to store, process and manage data over the internet. Cloud computing has largely affected companies and the ways they do their business. Cloud will cause a breakdown of the traditional relationship between IT and the business. Cloud adaption will likely be the source of unpredictable competition and cause turbulence within IT professionals to support the new model. However, in the end, most enterprises will benefit from the increased level of business value and opportunity that is a result of cloud computing. Cloud cannot only transform the way people consume IT resources, but also has the potential to transform and reinvent the whole IT organization. Cloud is giving access to a massive amount of data and computing power, enabling to solve problems in a whole new way. It has the potential to transform the way organizations view and deal with IT operations. Cloud computing has made a huge positive impact on the way business runs. It is expected that cloud computing will affect IT jobs in the next 5-10 years. Cloud is a matter of optimization through consolidation not replacing worker with automated mechanisms. Although few of the IT jobs will be affected like system management, database and network administrator in the short term but in the long run, there will be plenty of new jobs created. In fact, the cloud enables most start-ups to implement and sell ideas with a minimum initial investment. The newly created jobs will mostly belong to new kind of workers who have new skills, flexibility, agility and the ability to learn new things quickly required for cloud computing skills. There will be plenty of new jobs created like security architect and security engineer as security is a huge issue because of mobile and cloud computing everywhere.

    <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
<p>Cloud computing is technology that little by little is penetrating all fields. Sometimes, we may not realize that we are dealing with cloud computing but we are. We all use some form social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Tinder etc. All social media applications I use have cloud in one way or another. When I tend to upload photo it is stored in cloud. Even public figures and politicians too are now turning to engines such as twitter to get a feel of the community and convey their views. Before the cloud I can only watch shows in television or listen to radio but cloud has revolutionized how entertainment is delivered. We use Netflix, Apple play, Google play and they have one thing in common they all use cloud to deliver content. Everything Amazon recommends and your payment methods or card details are stored in cloud so that we don't have to do all these things again. These days students have schooling alternatives that most of us could only dream of. Universities now offer online courses across the country with some degrees being available entirely through Internet learning. The information, lessons and other materials utilized are stored in the cloud, giving students access to requested data anytime, anywhere. As for me I use an iphone and I save my pictures on icloud. I use Gmail email service; the information from these is stored on Google or Microsoft servers. This way whenever I need to shift to any other device I can easily do a backup of my phone (pictures, music, and data) save it on cloud. We all use cloud services in our daily life in one way or another we just don't know it yet.</p>

        <h3>Augmented Reality</h3>
        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
        <p>Augmented reality, often abbreviated to AR, creates holographic entities that appear to be becoming a part of your surroundings by adding digital elements onto a Smartphone device. Augmented reality defers from virtual reality, virtual reality immerses the user in a virtual world whereas augmented reality changes the current users' surroundings by adding elements such as 3D objects, sounds, videos and graphics. There are a lot of possibilities of augmented reality and it is used very often not just for work purposes but for everyday convenience and entertainment. multiple apps have been made that incorporates AR technology, one of the most famous examples is the Pokémon mobile game, Pokémon Go, which uses augmented reality as a part of its game to make it appear as if the game is taking place in the player's surroundings. This is one way that Augmented is used, although it is not just used through gaming purposes, there are multiple things that augmented reality can be used for, such as apps that can translate text into a different language and display the translated text next to the pre-existing text through the camera, augmented reality can also be used for other conventional purposes such as testing out how furniture may look in a room, by adding that 3D object and displaying it through the camera of the smartphone into the room, it is possible to select an item of furniture and set it in an area to judge how it looks and then decides whether or not you want to purchase it. Augmented reality aspects are also used a lot through social media, such as Snapchat and Instagram face filters, which are being used and created in a various of way such as adding objects around or on a persons face and also creating 3D objects that can be interacted with. In the future augmented reality may advance and create new ways it can be intertwined with daily life. It may become more of the norm for industries and workplaces to use it when training employees, since it may help to prevent employee injuries due to augmented reality helping to give more detail into a person's surroundings when teaching. Since augmented reality is heavily dependent on artificial intelligence (AI), as we make strides in the area of AI, augmented reality will only become more developed and incorporated in more aspects of daily life. With advancements in technology such as Tesla's autopilot (driver assistant system), augmented reality may be further introduced into the automobile industry. We may see advancements such as driving routes being graphically displayed through a windshield may become possible soon. With this, other things may also be possible such as having a full displayable dash on a windshield, including several of other things that will be making driving more convenient such as displaying the level of traffic in front of the driver and routes to take less traffic, since this already exists, with advancements of augmented reality it may become possible to display it through a windshield. It also may become possible to display other things such as the position of speed cameras or upcoming hazards. These types of advancements in technology may help prevent accidents and make the roads safer.</p>
        <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
        <p>With development into augmented reality technology, it may not only make working safer and more efficient, but it also may create new jobs. It will also add convenience to day to day life with augmented reality incorporation. Augmented reality will alter the entertainment industry with its potential involvement in interactive media. AR technology may not only create new jobs but make other jobs easier, safer and more efficient with AR technology becoming a powerful workplace tool. People who have jobs in manufacturing may mainly be affected by the increase advancements of augmented reality due to the possibilities that AR tech can bring into the processing industry. AR tech will be able to display specific instructions over individual pieces of equipment and projecting other instructions around the work area to make more complex tasks more conventional. Since AR can help people perform complex tasks or unfamiliar tasks, being guided by AR technology can help put people back to work, with the augmented reality tech helping as a guide to performing the tasks that their job requires. It will not only help new workers which need training but it will also assist veteran workers in the industry, allowing them to accomplish their work more quickly and allowing them to complete tasks which may be more difficult for them, allowing them to earn more money for their work. It may also increase productivity and efficiency of the global workforce since it may be possible to interact, in real-time, with a team which each person at their location.</p>
        <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
        <p>Augmented reality will affect my daily life through its involvement with daily processes, social media, gaming and potentially a future workspace. Future involvement of augmented reality will create new aspects of interactivity of social media making it possible for more creative ways for me to engage with friends online. Augmented reality will have the same effect on family and friends who share the same interests that include augmented reality, it has made communicating more entertaining and will continue to in the future when the possibilities it contains become reality. Currently, augmented reality is already engaged in the social media scene through filters such as the ones on Snapchat and Instagram which add imagery around or on a person's face. Due to features like this augmented reality is already a prominent feature in my life and with advancements in technology, it will only increase. Augmented reality will also progress through gaming, evolving its current state in the industry, becoming important aspects in games and creating more interactive games as well. this will affect daily life due to the current possibilities that augmented reality possesses in the gaming industry and since it will only continue to become stronger, this will affect my daily life and anyone who is interested in or has a gaming hobby, their daily life will be and has been affected by augmented reality due to its standing in the gaming scene. In the future augmented reality may affect my daily life because it may become an important aspect of my job, either as an aid or a main function.</p>

        <h3>Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</h3>
    <h4>What does it do?</h4>
    <p> The blockchain revolutionizes the creation of both scalable information technology systems and diversified applications by integrating the increasingly popular artificial intelligence, cloud computing. Various industries have recently begun to implement the exploration of blockchain. It will not take long for the blockchain to spread all over the world, To identify and further the development of the blockchain technology, this paper reviews the extant studies on the blockchain and its key components, blockchain-based IoT, blockchain-based security, blockchain-based data management, and the main applications based on the blockchain, and it defines potential trends and challenges. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art blockchain and describes a forward-looking direction. Blockchain is a solution for many things. It is up to you how you can use it to the maximum level. It is a new era of digital world; Blockchain is one of the technologies which are making the world a better place. Blockchain is the backbone for Cryptocurrency. It is also used to solve the problem of trust and human intervention from the equation. It also removes the problem of double-spending; it is a type of attack where the given set of coins is spent in more than one transaction. Double spending is one of the problems which can be solved by using blockchain technology. There are many more things to be solved and many of them are solved. So now it's your turn find the problems which have blockchain as a solution Step inside the basics of blockchain technology: how blocks contain data representing anything of value, how they're chronologically connected in an immutable chain, and the differences between blockchain and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Blockchain promotes new levels of trust and transparency. The food industry is just one of many being transformed through blockchain technology. Learn how it can trace when, where and how food has been grown, picked, shipped and processed, all while protecting network-participant data. Blockchain creates trust because it represents a shared record of the truth. Data that everyone can believe in will help power other new technologies that dramatically increase efficiency, transparency and confidence.</p>
   
    <h4>What is the likely impact?</h4>
   <p> Some economic analysts predict a big change in crypto is forthcoming as institutional money enters the market. Moreover, there is the possibility that cryptocurrency will be floated on the NASDAQ, which would further add credibility to blockchain and its uses as an alternative to conventional currencies. Some predict that all that cryptocurrency needs are a verified exchange-traded fund (ETF). An ETF would make it easier for people to invest in Bitcoin, but they still need to be the demand to want to invest in crypto, which some say may not automatically be generated with a fund.</p>

<p>Banking & Finance: A paradigm shift in the conventional methods of banking might occur in the near future. The concept of centralization has been embraced for hundreds of years and the introduction of bitcoin and its underlying technology (blockchain) gives rise to a new concept called decentralization. This concept gives more financial liberty to consumers and their financial management, ergo increasing transparency and freedom of the consumer's money. In contrary to that of traditional centralized entities (banks) which do not offer such benefits. Most importantly, upcoming cryptocurrencies are bringing the possibility of banking services to 2 billion unbanked people around the world (Buchko, 2018).</p>

<p>Remittance industry: Alternative methods of remittance like Bitcoin are gaining traction as a way to send large amounts of money peer-to-peer (P2P); in one example a bitcoin "whale" moved $468 million worth of bitcoin for less than $400. If we use TransferWise to send the same amount, they would've charged $1,684,800 to send $468 million, as opposed to under $400 (Canellis, 2019).</p>

<p>Financial systems: The conventional financial system is arguably flawed. Banks have the power to print money causing inflation in the dollar value, unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which are capped in supply. This reduces the effects of inflation (oversupply), therefore keeping the demand of the digital currency consistent. Bitcoin also has another mechanism called ‘halving' which cuts down miner rewards by half, forcing demand in the market (scarcity increases).</p>
    <h4>How will this affect you?</h4>
    <p>Grocery shopping is a necessity. It's something we do every day, or every week, and it's an important part of being a human. For years, we've gone to the shops, brought the food we need, paid by cash or card, and gone on our merry way. But now things might be changing. For example, In Safeway and Albertsons stores in California, Texas, and Washington, customers can now use in-house Coin star kiosks to buy Bitcoin, all whilst doing their weekly grocery shop. It's not like other Coin star machines, where you plug in coins and it adds them to your bank account or changes them up into other denominations. Instead, if you use one of the kiosks, you're essentially buying into digital currency. This technology will slowly, slowly seep through into the Australian market. While we're on the topic of the future, cryptocurrency will become the standard currency around the world, eliminating exchange rate fees and other costs that come with changing up money. But this is probably just a pipe dream. For cryptocurrency to become an integrated part of everyone's daily life, it needs to be easy for everyone to participate. To do this, there needs to be more education on what exactly Bitcoin and its digitized currency counterparts are and how they can benefit general daily tasks. As soon as people from all corners of the globe can realize the pros of cryptocurrency and are happy to take advantage of them, we're likely to start seeing new businesses flourish in this arena. Instead of paying hefty bank-enforced transaction fees, even the smallest of companies will be able to save money and carry out quicker transactions with the technology surrounding cryptocurrency. This new 'jump' will affect us all on our day to day lives, including family and friends. It will change the way we do things forever.</p>
