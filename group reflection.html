        <h1> Group reflection </h1>
        <h2>What went well</h2>
      <p>We all agree that this is one of the best groups that we have been in since our time starting at RMIT, in terms of productivity and ‘synergy’. No one complains about the workload they are assigned, instead, they try and do more and increase our group work’s quality. Another thing that we noticed that we all have strengths and capabilities, and therefore we’re able to seamlessly do our group work without any hitches, with full confidence in each other’s skillsets and that we will undoubtedly be able to get through any tasks that are thrown our way in this subject.</p>
       <h2>What can be improved</h2>
      <p>Overall there wasn't too many areas our group could improve on as we all did the work and ensured we submitted on time. Even though one member submitted things late, he still submitted sufficient work. One thing we could improve on is time management, as we could have added in more information and made more complicated designs throughout the website.</p>

        <h2>At least one thing that was surprising</h2>
      <p>One thing surprising was how well each member in the group, was able to express their ideas and thoughts without feeling like they were not included or heard, we all got along tremendously well and we will continue and grow as a team.</p>
      <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h2>
      <p>No matter how different members in a group can be there is always something that they can relate to, for us, it was this subject that brought us together but through calls and messages we were able to find similarities within each member allowing new friendships to blossom.</p>
