                <h4>Topic:</h4>
                <h5>Our team, Master Chef, propose to create a robotic surveillance machine that can be used in both large scale industries or personal spaces, such as the homes of fellow citizens. This bot Automated Security Surveillance Bot (ASSB) is planned out to be practical and cost-efficient for every class, as each consumer, will be granted a slice of ‘professional’ and give each a peace of mind regarding their safety. ASSB is currently being designed in terms of theory, to one day be manufactured as a basic security system for the people of the future. A huge market with a lot of gaps, security system, especially the ‘mobile’, easily accessible, and affordable aspect of our design, will be able to attract, even the smallest investors and consumers if demonstrated and marketed correctly.</h5>
                <h5>The idea of the prototype model of ASSB was conceived after pooling our ‘talent’ resource, involving around almost 18 hours of sharing and dissection of suggestions. We compared our differences and strengths, and then found a middle ground between the contrasting industries that would allow the entire team to contribute the skills that they will learn from their educational journey, including while working. A conjunction of Robotics, Software Engineering and Development, and Cybersecurity Engineering, ASSB is the brainchild of the combined contributions of the idea from differing students with different goals. Huge market and big gaps considered, there are still numerous critical competitors that are going to prove hard to challenge as a newcomer to the field of security and robotic surveillance.</h5>
                <h4>Motivation:</h4>
                <h5>One of the biggest competitor in the market right now that we have been discussing of is IC REALTIME (https://www.icrealtime.com/), which is a leading digital surveillance manufacturer right now who combines modern and futuristic technology such as cameras, artificial intelligence, and facial recognition functionality into their surveillance system. They have been contracted by militaries in multiple countries, as well as government agencies. They also cater to the residential and commercial slice of the Surveillance and AI market. Trying to compete and gain market shares against this kind of a company will be extremely challenging, and the unlikeliness of our product taking over is exceedingly high. Our proposed project, the prototype ASSB has the same capability of their lower ranges of automated surveillance system. However, most of them are just security cameras, doorbells, fingerprint locks, and more. This means that our roaming ‘robot’ ASSB will have an edge in terms of a wider range of capabilities. It is also imperative to emphasize that the goal of ASSB is to become an affordable all-around system for a wide variety of people, which are mainly commercial and residential. One of the main aims of our project and plan is to create a trusted and reliable brand, and to demonstrate the combined effort of a group of people with varying careers.</h5>
                <h4>Landscape:</h4>
                <h5>One of the biggest problems we have discovered as of now, is the security risk it poses to people. The data being ‘live-streamed’ to an application must have a unique key and address that are both heavily encrypted. Until we can figure out a solution to this crucial issue, we will have to continue researching before trying to emerge in this market.</h5>
            <p></p>

                <h1>Aims</h1>
              <p>The main aim of our project is to design a bot that can provide an extra hand for security for shops, houses etc. when there’s no one present. As in these modern times it is really difficult to completely monitor important places and to secure them properly. Data shows that there is a significant amount of increase in cases of thefts and burglary in local shops and houses when no one is present. As security cameras only monitor a particular area as it is fixed on a single spot. But the bot we are going to design will roam around the place with number of motion detector sensors and noise sensitivity devices in order to scan any suspicious activities around them and inform to the place owners.</p>
               <p>In order to achieve this aim we have to achieve smaller goals that are:</p>
                <p><strong>Mapping the area:</strong> It would be difficult for robot to move around the house itself as it can be stuck into some places where it could be difficult for robot to get out of itself. So, in order to roam freely around the house our team first carefully has to map the area bot is going to protect and store it into the robots internal memory. Our team could also be able to store the areas of focus where bot should roam more frequently than other places like near the storage lockers, windows and doors.</p>
               <p> <strong>Internet connectivity:</strong> In order to transmit any suspicious activities to its owner there should be 24/7 internet connectivity. It is very difficult to maintain a consistent connection with internet as its speed tends to fluctuate which could break the connection of robot with its owner. To prevent this from happening robot should be equipped with signal amplifiers that can easily catch the Wi-Fi signal even from a range. Our would set up a secure connection to owner as with the help of that owner can even watch the live feeds or recorded ones.</p>
               <p> <strong>Able to detect nearby motion: </strong>Our team will equip the robot with number of motion detector sensors that will detect even the slightest of the motions and will pursue towards the location. If anything is wrong it will quickly notify the owner and ask for further instructions like contacting the authorities or by activating the alarms of that place.</p>
               <p><strong> Able to Detect noises: </strong>Robot will have noise detector sensors on it to record the noises when no one’s home. It would be programmed in a way to analyse those noises and if found anything suspicious or wrong it will send Intruder alerts to owner.</p>
               <p> <strong>Battery Reserves:</strong> Sometimes robot could need to work continuously for 3-4 days without being charged in order to do that robot should have best battery storage device and capacitors that should store enough amount of energy so that it can go without charging for many days. Our team will programme robot in a way that it will be active only when there is disturbance around. When there’s no noise or any kind of disturbance for a long period of time it could be able to switch its power to standby mode which will help to save power for longer use.</p>
               <p><strong>Data Security and protection from hacking:</strong> As robot will be able to store the footage of house and other places that can provide a chance for hackers to stole that data and use it for bad purposes. So our team will store video footage and other data on protected servers and will make the data unreachable for hackers. All the recoding and live feeds will be only accessed by owner not anyone else. Anti-hacking measures will be installed in robot by our team to ensure the data it stores is protected at all costs.</p>
                
               
               
               <h1>Plans and Progress</h1>
                <p> During the phase of planning for Assignment 2, our group, Master Chef, decided to commit to a future project plan of assessing, developing, and fully creating an automated machine (AI) that is programmed to roam and monitor a certain location, especially high risk areas, such as superstores, bank vaults, and even a consumer’s personal home. The goal is to program this ‘robot’ (which we have named Automated Security Surveillance Bot, pronounced ‘AZBIE’) alongside a phone application that will let you connect to the said machine for real-time monitoring purposes. This machine will be equipped with well-placed high-resolution cameras in order to maximize mobility and at the same time, provide the best functionality possible. ASSB was initially planned to have different ‘modes’ as well, where the user or owner can watch a ‘live-stream’ of ASSB from their phones as it roams around using a pre-determined or planned pathway, or if the user chooses to, they would be able to control and move it remotely. ASSB will have a cylindrical shaped body with a rounded head to allow the possibility of a 360 degree view of a certain surrounding at any given time.</p> 
                <p> The functionality of ASSB was a big priority when it came to the project planning, as our team did not want to create an already existing machine that functioned the same way. Our team, Master Chef, wanted to create and in the future, revolutionise, home surveillance machines that would be small, lightweight, and affordable for the general population. ASSB is the prototype model that is very essential to that end product goal that we have in mind. We have a design in mind for the prototype that involves the chassis being very efficient in materials to reduce cost, only leaving the necessary components inside and a little bit of shock-proofing in case of bumping into walls (which we don’t intend to happen.) However, this is exactly where our first problem comes from. Nowadays, materials for anything a person wants to craft is practically incredibly accessible, as the internet is a wide place where you can search for anything that you need. But, the problem is the cost in the form of money, as you lose money as you build your project that requires any components, which then drains time. While time is being drained, we expect to take hits from our funding, therefore losing money exponentially. The only potential safety net here is that if we can construct a prototype model quickly, either through the help of skilled professionals, or through intensive non-stop efficient work between each group members.</p> 
                <p> The second problem, yet again, involves money once more. Hiring professionals would most likely be hard, as some prefer contracts, while others only do per-hour payments. This means that even if we hire very skilled professionals, we will still have to work with as much efficiency as Master Chef can muster to cut costs. Finding professionals to hire is much easier than gathering funds, unless our team can be able to apply for a grant from university later on, or look for potential investors. Otherwise, we would have to fund ourselves straight from our own coffers.</p> 
                <p> A lot of intensiveness in terms of focus and dedication is required for this subject, therefore taking away time from our personal lives as well. This is why our team has been planning for quite a while a ‘system’ that helps us manage our own individual time effectively. The system that we have devised as a team involves delegating and assigning parts to each member that accommodates to their strength and minimise their weaknesses by spreading and splitting core parts. Right after the distribution, we would be able to construct a schedule, most likely in the form of a table, such as a Gantt chart. With this system, we should be able to start our project as quickly as possible and keep working on it at an optimal pace. For testing purposes, our team is considering using virtual programs to first test out which designs are cost-efficient and are feasible physics-wise. There is a big industry that deals with this type of virtual ‘physical’ prototyping, but what we are keeping an eye out for is EDR Medeso’s Digital Prototyping. (https://digitallabs.edrmedeso.com/digital-prototypes)</p>
                <p>  Medeso’s Digital Prototyping and the likes in the same industry allow developers to consult with professionals that will help with simulating physics digitally. This is important in a product to accommodate every little factor that may potentially prove hindrance in the future. ‘Hunting’ and eliminating as much chances of error as we can will help preserve our future product’s integrity and build quality. Prototyping ASSB is crucial, as this is a mechanical technology, and therefore, every little ‘cogs’ must be in the most optimal spots, as well as the expensive technology it may carry on it, such as the 360 cameras and sensors. Prototyping with professionals may be expensive, but it is something that we will get the maximum value of, as we can plan any design improvements with this, or even redesign ASSB completely, depending on the results, saving our team much needed resources like time and money from being needlessly spent and wasted.</p> 
                <p>  Past our planning phase, our team has been taking steps that are crucial to kickstart our journey. Aiming to be a Robotic Engineer, Tanveer has been learning how to program, as well as sharply and regularly observing robotics tutorial online. Aydan and Francis Kiel have been looking at suitable programming languages to accommodate and supplement the basic programming skill to at least make a basic machine move, like Lego Mind-storms with python and more. Charlotte and Laura have been planning every step of our schedule, even for the future steps. Charlotte and Francis have also been managing the HTML, CSS, and the website for our team at the same time. Adi, on the other hand, have been researching the possible materials and components we may need to create a mini prototype of ASSB. Our team has been synergising well, constantly improving our teamwork and individual skills while we learn together.</p> 
                <p> However, there has been quite a lot of issues when it comes to work commitments, especially with other courses running and clashing with Intro to IT. Some group members have been unable to dedicate a set time that follows our workflow plan. This reduces the very efficiency we have been striving to gain, effectively setting us back quite some time. Combined with this issue, there has been problems with the learning pace between each member. Granted, none the members are at fault when it comes to these issues, but our team needs to find a solution to this as soon as possible, or face the risk of starting later, rather than sooner. Our plan of continuing to learn and gather sufficient resources to construct a ‘mini’-prototype of ASSB may stop temporarily but start again once the semester or semester break finishes.</p> 
                <p> Another issue, arguably the biggest one, is regarding the workflow. There has been no problem with delegation, and everybody has been willing and enthusiastic with doing their work so far. The issue, however, lies within the ‘chain’ system of our workload. There has been a lot of bottlenecks within the project, even just within the planning phase, where everybody had to pool in thoughts and ideas, but the confirmation has always resided with key members like Charlotte and Francis, as other members have been either neutrally productive, or unsure with taking initiatives. This has caused significant delays and in result, has been greatly increasing the workload for Charlotte and Francis, who have shared some of the most difficult and crucial aspects of the project, as per their strengths. The other members have been trying to step up and work together to finish their tasks together, but we have yet to solve this bottlenecks, either through a more efficient workflow, where everybody may gain confidence enough to take their own initiatives, and not have to rely on complete confirmations from others. Relying on grammar, fact, and spelling checking has been also reducing some of the quality of work some members have been putting in.</p> 
                <p> Beyond these learning, communication, and workflow issues, our team has been growing steadily, and we hope to push through each of these setbacks. For the nearby future, we might consult and reach out to any of our known professional connections (including family members who may be familiar with robotics, general programming, or even mechanics. Any helpful advice from people knowledgeable with Physics may be able to greatly help us too, as Physics is always used in conjunction with mechanical engineering, especially in development or creation of moving mechanical machines. We also plan to ask robotics professionals online where we can get properly started to develop such ideas.</p>

                <h1>Roles</h1>
              <h4>Charlotte & Kiel – Lead Developers</h4>  
              <p>Our group is a mix between team roles and no specific roles. Charlotte and Kiel are both Lead Developers with a strong leadership capability in organising the times for group meetings and encouraging the team to meet team deadlines for work submission. Their role was not defined by votes but by a natural unfoldings in their prior experience in leading our team to success in previous assignments. They are both working on HTML and CSS for the team as they’re both individually experienced in the opposing coding language between each other. This means that while the other has difficulties in one coding language, the other is experienced and can provide insight into problems they run into and vice versa.</p>
              <h4>Tanveer, Adi, Aydan, Laura – No specific role</h4>
              <p>The rest of the team have no specific roles as we all chose two different topics to cover, with one being difficult and the other topic to write about is much easier. This assists the team to equal the workload between team members. This also provides the opportunity for each member to work on different kinds of IT topics and work. We provide support and solutions to HTML and CSS problems that are voiced during team meetings and complete written tasks.</p>

              <h1>Scope and Limits</h1>
                <p>Our group project idea is quite complex which means we will need to break our project up initially to make it simple enough to understand the gist of what our project delivers, but also is reasonable enough in the amount of time we have. Our end project idea is a Home Security Bot which can be used at home or at stores to travel its environment to monitor criminal activity such as break-ins and thieves. It does this by recording, capturing screenshots and recording its surrounding area as it travels through its designated area. It has multiple cameras, a microphone and can send the user notifications through an app. We can narrow the complexity of this project by describing the deliverables for our project. Our project must include an AI bot who roams its environment and has at least a single camera and microphone that can send a notification to the user when it senses movement and can live stream its footage and audio. We can dismiss many other features till much later in its development. These features include having multiple cameras, the ability to set its designated roaming area and user to bot commands. Another feature that is time-consuming and complex which should be left till the last development phase is the bot’s ability to recognise a sound and travel to its location to supervise and record. It was also planned that the bot when used in stores, warehouses etc. will be able to check stock, however that is very technical and will need to be filtered out in the first development phase of the bot demonstration. Notifications sent to the user at first will be very simple and will only send messages to the user when a movement in the bot’s vision can be detected. The movement can be anything and as the project progresses through to the end-product, it will be able to distinguish between a human and other movements and objects.The live streaming of video footage and audio will be available when the user opens the bot via an app on their phone and when motion is detected when the user is absent, the bot will record the footage and audio of this. Otherwise the bot’s recorded footage will not be accessible, it will only record footage when it detects motion.</p>
              


                <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
                <p><strong>Software required:</strong></p>  
                <p>In order to control the robot’s functions an app will be developed by our IT team that will control its movements, store the data and other functions and commands. This app will be developed with python language by one our team’s app developer. Robot must also include Stereo vision module, Visual navigation module, on-board computer and navigation module. As for the robots navigation systems adaptive motion control subsystem will be used that will set and tracks a motion path and adjust control actions according to robots maneuver, speed and it also stops the robot in emergency situations. The robot will also include a robotic application programming interface (API) that will enhance its decision making capabilities to some level.</p>
                <p><strong>Hardware required:</strong> </p>
                <p>A highly advanced video surveillance system will installed on robot with plenty of high definition cameras that will be able to record clearly in low light environment with high pixel quality. Robot will have advance motion detector sensors as well as noise detector sensors on its body that will increase the security provided by robot. In order for robot to move it will have a small engine with wheels that will allow the robot to move. Robot will have rotatory motors that will make robot to move and record 360 degree. It will also have built-in Wi-Fi antenna, LED lights for night motion, robot status color indicator and console with LED diagnostic panel, wheels and tires for its movements.</p>
               
               
                <h1>Testing</h1>
                <p>The Automated Security Surveillance bot will undergo several tests to ensure that it not only is functional but is operating at its best. First initial testing will be held via a digital prototype to fully understand how the ASSB will function and what it can be capable of. Tests will then not just be held at the end of the production but it will also be held throughout the process of the production of the security bot. Testing will first commence with a prototype minimalistic version of the bot to ensure that all programming is properly written and that the individual components are properly functional. Tests will be conducted on its mobility and its responsiveness with the app via remote connection and Bluetooth. These tests will also include whether the security bot can use its cameras and can identify things in the field of view the cameras provide. Further testing will be conducted when a proper model of the ASSB has been constructed. These tests will be like the previous testing but will be handled more thoroughly. Testing will be conducted by the team hired to construct the ASSB. We will know if the project is successful when the ASSB will be able to move around a location by itself using its camera to identify objects and obstructions also it will be able to record what it sees and note anything of suspicious nature.</p>

We made sure to have a fair work share as everyone had two parts of the Project Ideas section, we decided each member should have an easy one and a harder one so everyone had their fair share. To ensure everyone was doing alright with the work we had a follow-up call, where any of the group members could ask for help or clarification on a question, the call was successful and ideas of updating the previous website were questioned as well.  For Kiel and Charlotte as Tech leads, they needed to fix the Navigation bar to be responsive to screen size as well as adjusting the index page to the same standards. As we all decided to keep the pre-existing website, some changes needed to be made such as IT Work and IT technologies needed to be removed and replaced with Project Description and Project Ideas. We also decided that a documentation/tools pages to organise web-references, this time frame and video recordings from teams. Our main milestone for the week was just to familiarise everyone to the tasks they have been assigned too. </td>

                <h1>Risks</h1>
                <p>Our project idea is to create a Robot surveillance device that can be used in both large scale industries or smaller scale, such as homes and offices. Our Automated Security Surveillance Bot (ASSB) is planned to be practical and cost-efficient for every class, as we plan to work with industries that produce our parts, so we can reduce the products cost so everyday users will be able to afford our product and receive the security they deserve. As robot surveillance is a new field, they can be easily hacked into if there is a weak connection between the Bluetooth connection and database where it stores the videos. We plan to avoid this issue by using the latest wireless technology and ensuring to use a secured database to ensure there is no private footage leaked. Another common risk includes software crashes such as system freezing/lagging, Hardware issues are common but with newer technology, we can maintain a smooth outflow of footage, plus we will suggest users come in store once or twice a year for an annual checkup and service of the device. Other risks associated is a human risk such as someone tampering with the unit for example physically harming the equipment or trying to hack into the bot, which at this stage we are unable to completely remove this risk as we are creating a robot to do surveillance that depends on a human to charge the system</p>
                <h1> Group Processes and communication</h1>  
                <p>In order to communicate officially, Master Chef has agreed as a group to meet every week at least once or twice in order to share ideas, complaints, and progress over our group’s Microsoft Teams’ channel. However, our team also recognized the fact that sometimes, some ideas or thoughts may come and go in a quick moment. Therefore, we all agreed to stay connected using social media’s such as Facebook Messenger, where messages are timestamped and logged, in the case that proof of an informal meeting is ever required. In order to deter group members from not attending formal meetings, we have implemented a rule and consequence from the previous assignments as a group, where the person that does not attend a meeting or contribute, without a valid excuse, should and will be marked lower than the rest of the group either through SparkPlus or communicating with a Tutor, Professor, or a Program Manager.</p>    
                <p>So far, every group meeting has been held whenever every group member is free, which are most of the time Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. The group attendance has been pristine in terms of everyone being able to join every meeting we have done so far. The troubles lie within the workflow and work ethics, which are all discussed in the ‘Plans and Progress’ section of this assignment. The group’s communication and connection, however, have both been strong in contrast, gathering a high productivity rate despite having the minimum official contact required.</p>
