    <h2>Group Project</h2>
    <h4>Our Group IT Project idea is a Home security bot which can be used in designated locations within the business's or owners homes, which allows the bot to take recording and photos when it is surrounding become suspicious in which the footage is sent to the users app. </h4>

        <h3>Project Ideas</h3>
<p>Our group IT project idea Is a Home Security bot which can move around its designated location and recording and taking photos of things it may find suspicious which its owner will be able to review via its corresponding app. The security bot is not just restricted to home security though, it can be also bought and used for commercial use, such as at supermarkets and shops etc. we came up with this project as a way to incorporate our future ideal jobs in a certain way, and the security fills a market, with technology advancing people and companies will want the best security system to protect themselves and this could be that new step in home and commercial security.</p>
<p>The security bot will have multiple cameras installed on it not just for recording but to improve its movability, to allow it to manoeuvre around the location it is in more efficiently. The owner can set up a dedicated floor plan of the area or areas that they want the security bot to patrol, as the security bot moves around the area it becomes more calibrated and will move more smoothly. Through the app, the owner may see in real-time what the bot sees also be able to send commands to the security bot to send it to a certain room or other commands such as take a photo. </p>
 <p>The robot will also have audio recognition so it will be able to pick up noises and if it hears a loud noise it will be able to automatically make its way over to the commotion to record what is happening. The security bot will also be able to send the owner alerts such as an intruder alert to inform the owner of the events of what is taking place. The bot will also be able to scan old photos it has taken to compare what it currently sees, this will help in scenarios where it can check to see if there are broken windows and other things that may be out of place, too prevent confusion the owner can also inform via the app any things they have moved and may alert the bot to prevent unnecessary notifications. This feature will also be helpful in commercial situations such as being able to check the stocks on shelves during closed times, the bot will also be able to scan item codes. The security bot will move via the wheels that pivot to give it full manoeuvrability, although areas that are sanctioned off via stairs will not be able to be patrolled by the security bot, although if something like a ramp is placed it will be able to progress.  </p>      
<p>It will have cameras placed on each side to record its surrounding but with this camera placement, it will be able to move without collisions. The security bot will have a cylinder-like body with a rounded off head. The owner will also be able to set the charging times they want and at the specified times the security bot will make its way to its dedicated charging dock. The security botsâ€™ recordings and photos will be saved and uploaded via the cloud, which the owner can watch over at any point. If the project is successful it will be able to protect homes and become a new and improved security system, but the system can also be set with cameras to maximise security and protection. Similarly, the security bot by itself will essentially not be enough to replace security guards but combined with the security will prosper and become stronger. And since the robot will not need a break it can constantly be working even over the night to fully protect its household or shop. </p>
