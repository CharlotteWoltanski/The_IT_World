Team Name
You are free to choose any name for your group that you wish. However, this name will be used to identify your
group for the rest of the course, so please choose wisely. You should also keep in mind that this name could be
one that comes to the attention of potential employers. 


Tools
Having set up an individual website using AWS, you should now set up a group website, also on AWS, using the same
approach. You should then include hyperlinks to each individual AWS website on the group website.


You also need to set up a GitHub repository for your group on which you can use Git. This is to facilitate the production
and maintenance of group artefacts, which will include the assignment submission, but may also include other reports or
information, code, examples, formatted data, images and videos, links, and similar information. In using github, we
expect that each of you will be working on individual files and that you should be pushing and pulling the files that you
work on through your central group respository. Marks will be allocated on your Git usage as per your logs.
You will also need to set up your group on Canvas. Do this immediately.

In your HTML-based report which is on AWS, you should include a brief description of what you have done, and include
the following
• The link to your group’s Git repository
• Your comments on how well the audit trail on the Git repository reflects your group’s work. You will presumably only
be able to do this close to the time of submission.)
• A bullet pointed list of web resources that you used to compile your report 

Project ideas
You all have some project ideas that you reported in Assignment 1. You are to come up with a project idea for the
group as a whole, which could be an individual’s idea, but is more likely to be a combination of each of the ideas you
had individually, together with comments and feedback from your Assignment 1 marker, your tutor, the lecturer, and
anyone else who you would like to consult.
You may also wish to consider what problems need to be solved, for which there are many sources of information. For
example, you could search for
• What are the biggest problems in the global economy in 2020
• What are the biggest problems in IT and Computing in 2020
• What are the biggest problems in Data Securit in 2020
• etc
Use only recent and properly presented and researched web search results.
There is no set length for this section, but it is difficult to see how a description of less than 600 words would be
adequate. Do not limit yourself to this if you have more than this to write, though. If you are unsure of how much to
write, ask your tutor or lecturer for advice. Again, be careful to avoid any plagiarising.
