Feedback
By the time you get to Week 8, you should have been working as a group for three weeks, and hence have some
experience of how well the group is working. A key feature of industry teams is the ability to give and receive feedback,
particular to members of a team in which you are working.
In the next assignment we will use SparkPLUS as a tool where you give feedback to each other, such that the feedback
will affect your individual marks. For this assignment, we will ask each of you to write a paragraph of feedback about the
perceived contribution and performace of each member of the group. Therefore, assuming a group consists of A, B, C
and D. Then A’s Feedback section will give 3 paragraphs of feedback about B, C amd D. B will give feedback about A, C
and Dr etc.
If you have any concerns with this process, please raise these with your tutor or lecturer.


Group Reflection
Towards the end of the assignment period, you should reflect as a group on how well you think you have performed in
this assignment. You should include whatever evidence you may have about the groups processes (such as commit
trails from GitHub, project meeting minutes ). Each member of the group should contribute up to 200 words about their 3
own perception of the group, and the group as a whole should contribute around 400 words. This should include the
following attributes.
● What went well
● What could be improved
● At least one thing that was surprising
● At least one thing that you have learned about groups
● Remember to include in your section on Tools how well you think your Github log of activity reflects your
group’s work on this assignment.
