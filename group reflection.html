        <h2>What went well</h2>
      
   <p>As a group, our collected response still remain the same in the sense of being completely compatible and united in each of our group works. Although there have been some issues with work ethics of some members, the morale of the group is still high. We feel like we have utilised our strengths and weaknesses correctly thanks to careful planning and delegation, which boosted each of our confidence. Looking back from the first group assignment, our hard work and perseverance has gotten us through up until now. We know that this fruit of our time and labor is the best we could have done, considering every circumstances and scenario.</p> 
   <h2>What can be improved</h2>
   <p>  From our past criticisms and ‘weak’ areas in our assessments from our group member feedbacks, we tried our best to improve our time management as a group, as well as increase communications by creating a non-formal channel through Messenger where we can freely give our thoughts and group criticism as they come (as mentioned in the Communications part of this assignment).</p>   
        <h2>At least one thing that was surprising</h2>
        <p>Every member felt as if they were included and important, just like the previous assignments, no matter how much they have contributed. This is important because we would rather have an inclusive and mentally healthy workplace, rather than segregating or creating a divide between those who do work, and someone who does not. We have also learnt how to deal with creative differences in terms of ideas and how we decide to implement or plan to execute those.</p>   
        <h2>At least one thing that you have learned about groups</h2>
        <p>  We have learned a lot, not just as individuals, but more importantly, as a group. We learned to adjust to circumstances, differing ideas, and ideals, which we think is the most valuable and crucial lesson we could pick up from this program, besides the technical skills, due to the fact that we will need to do the same when we enter the IT industry when we start working. Another application of this is in our daily lives, where we have to coexist with others.</p>
