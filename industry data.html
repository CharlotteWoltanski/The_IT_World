<h3>Our Ideal Professions and Their Demand In Today's Market</h3>

<p>MasterChef's members (besides Laura and Adi) are all aiming to get into the big industry of Cyber Security, but in different niches of the market.

Aydan and Kiel are focused on the software engineering and development side, while Charlotte is leaning more towards to becoming an Analyst. On the other hand, Laura wants to become a Software Developer for a research institute due to her previous Medical background before IT, while Adi aspires to be a Software Engineer that is flexible in many fields (including Cyber Security). Tanveer has also decided to dive into a more specific market of Software Engineering, which is Robotics because he wants to design and program robotic systems.</p>

<p>Software Engineering is at the top of the market in terms of 'Demand' in the InfoTech industry netting a total of 3,975 job posts during Aug 2018 â€“ Aug 2019. However, Test Analysts and System Analyst received 1,959 and 1,929 job posts respectively, with Software Developers a couple of hundred posts behind at 1,519. These figures, despite having some significant number of differences in terms of job demands, are all at the top of the IT market.</p>

<h3>General Skills</h3>
 <p>The ideal job of each of MasterChef's members are very possible to reach, however the skills that will be required of each of us are going to need a lot of time and dedication for us to prosper with in the field.</p>
 <p>The general skills that people considering going into the IT field, like our group, should have are:</p>
 <p>Organization</p>
 <p>Communications</p>
 <p>Perseverance</p>
 <p>Problem Solving</p>
 <p>Creativity</p>
 <p>Curiosity</p>

 <h3>IT Specific Skills</h3>
 <p>It may not look as big as the IT hand-on skills on a resume, but these will help increase productivity, and even help someone improve their hands-on skill along with the person's experience. The IT-specific skills that we need are almost all the same, but with a bit of variance depending on what a company is looking for. So far according to the job descriptions that we have individually chosen, they are:</p>
 <p>Software Engineers and Developers must be proficient with programming and coding, so experience and proficiency in Java, JavaScript, and Python would give us an edge over competitors because the coding field is vast and has a lot of competition between coders and developers. Experience and time spent developing these skills are very much, most of the time, the difference between getting hired or not. Robotics</p>

<p>An Analyst like Charlotte would need knowledge in programming languages too, but also some knowledge and experience in Databases and SQL because they would need to review attacks or penetration attempts from external sources, which some uses SQL injections and the likes to bypass and reach their goal (usually to steal data). Cyber Security Analysts must be knowledgeable in knowing how to thwart these threats proactively and reactively in many levels and layers. The Analyst position, however, requires a lot of time to be spent reviewing attack 'vectors' and firewall logs before commencing or advising what to do next.</p>

<h3>The IT Skill Market</h3>
 <p>IDuring the period of August 2018 to August 2019, the skills we require, such as SQL (5,529), Java (4,742), JavaScript (3,851), and Python (2,769) all rank in the top 4 of the most listed skill required and demanded.</p>


<h3>General Skills Ranked</h3>
 <p>The professional skills demanded according to the same 2018-2019 timeframe indicates that Communication Skills is the most sought after skill, having about 10,415 jobs requiring Communication Skills in IT. Problem Solving came at second with 5,269 postings, and Creativity at ninth place with 1,798 listings.</p>

 <h3>Highest Ranked IT Skills We Could Develop</h3>
 <p>LINUX (2169), Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) (1,935), and Scrum (1,836) are all not required in our specified professions, although Linux is still used a lot for programming nowadays, and may be required of us in the future depending on the project.</p>
 
 <h3>Highest Ranked General Skills We Could Work On</h3>
 <p>Planning, Writing, and Research are skills that are supposed to be in high demand. However, it most likely is going to be required by the time we get to our professions, especially Tanveer and Charlotte's jobs, as they must keep on researching and planning, which involves them writing a lot too. For the software engineers and developers in our group, planning and writing is also essential, but so far it has not been listed for our specified jobs.</p>

 <h3>Has Our Ideal Jobs Changed?</h3>
 <p>MasterChef's members have decided not to shift our stance on the professions we all desire, mostly because it is still part of the most sought after in the IT job market.</p> <p>Our chance of getting employment is much higher now than it was, especially Software Engineers which, according to the 2017-2018 Burning Glass analysis, had only 539 job postings for Software Engineers, as compared to the 2018-2019 analysis which showcased an increase of 3,436 job postings at 3,975. Software developers back then only had 337 postings, being the lowest out of all the groups' future profession. Test analyst had 555, which had a bit of a better demand than Software Engineering by 16 job postings. Test analysts have always been in demand, and will continue to be in the future, and so will our software engineering and development roles, as the demand just keeps on increasing.</p>
